# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Tkinter

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented using Python's `tkinter` library! This project is a simple graphical version of the classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## 🚀 Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend in a head-to-head match.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using `tkinter` for a clean and easy-to-use interface.
- **Reset Button**: Start a new game at any time with the reset button.
- **Winning Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner or a tie.

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started, you'll need Python installed on your machine. This game uses the `tkinter` library, which comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshatjaiin/TICTAKTOE-TKINTER.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-tkinter
   ```

2. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe.py
   ```

## 📜 How to Play

1. Launch the game by running the `tiktactoe.py` file.
2. The game board will appear in a new window.
3. Player 1 (X) starts first. Click on an empty cell to place your mark.
4. Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the grid.
5. The game automatically checks for a winner after each move. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
6. To start a new game, click the "Reset" button.

## 🎨 GUI Overview

- **Grid**: A 3x3 grid where players place their marks.
- **Reset Button**: Located below the grid, used to restart the game.

## 🏆 Winning Conditions

A player wins if they manage to place three of their marks in:
- A horizontal row
- A vertical column
- A diagonal line

If all cells are filled and no player meets the winning conditions, the game results in a tie.
